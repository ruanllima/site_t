            <hr class="text-slate-200">
            <p class="font-light text-slate-400">I am an enthusiast of technology and innovation, with a particular interest in programming and entrepreneurship. I have participated in several innovation marathons, hackathons, and events focused on technology and artificial intelligence, such as Campus Party Nordeste 2024 and Trakto Show 2024. My involvement with the startup ecosystem has provided me with essential communication and public speaking skills, such as delivering a "Pitch," while also broadening my perspective on various fields.

            <p class="font-light text-slate-400">Additionally, I had the opportunity to compete in entrepreneurship challenges, such as the Desafio Liga Jovem, where I collaborated with my schoolmates to develop a game from scratch. Although I do not consider myself a game developer, this experience allowed me to explore new tools like Unity and the C# language, expanding my technical knowledge.

This environment was crucial in developing my passion for programming, allowing me to interact with people who share the same desire for growth while learning from renowned professionals from across Brazil. This experience also gave me valuable opportunities to learn from and engage with prominent scientists from around the world.
